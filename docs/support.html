    <p>Everything you need to know about securing your digital asset estate plan.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Is my data really private?</strong>
        <p>Yes — 100%. StackStats Estate Vault stores all data exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. There are no servers, no cloud sync, no accounts, and no tracking. We use a zero-knowledge architecture, which means we literally cannot see your data. Your wallet addresses, recovery phrases, trusted contacts, and documents never leave your device through the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What happens if I lose my phone or it's stolen?</strong>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, losing your phone means losing access to your StackStats Estate Vault data — unless you've taken precautions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Export regularly:</strong> Use the Export feature to create PDF or encrypted backups of your vault. Store these securely (e.g., in a safe, with your estate attorney, or on an encrypted USB drive).</li>
            <li><strong>Face ID protection:</strong> If your phone is stolen, the thief cannot access StackStats Estate Vault without your face or device passcode.</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud backups:</strong> If you use encrypted iCloud backups or encrypted local backups via Finder/iTunes, your app data may be included. However, we recommend explicit exports as your primary backup strategy.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I export or back up my vault?</strong>
        <p>Go to the Export screen in the app. You can generate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PDF Report:</strong> A comprehensive document listing all your assets, contacts, recovery instructions, and estate letter. Great for printing and storing in a safe.</li>
            <li><strong>Encrypted Export:</strong> A secured file you can store digitally. Share it via AirDrop, save to Files, or email it to yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We strongly recommend exporting your vault periodically and storing copies in a secure location.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I set up Face ID / biometric lock?</strong>
        <p>Open StackStats Estate Vault and go to Security Settings. Toggle on "Require Face ID" (or Touch ID on supported devices). The app will ask for your permission to use biometric authentication. Once enabled, StackStats Estate Vault will require Face ID every time you open the app or return from the background.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I share my vault with trusted contacts?</strong>
        <p>StackStats Estate Vault doesn't automatically share data with your trusted contacts (by design — this protects you). Instead, the recommended approach is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add your trusted contacts in the app with their details and assigned assets</li>
            <li>Write your estate letter using the Letter feature — this explains everything to your heirs</li>
            <li>Export your vault as a PDF or encrypted file</li>
            <li>Store the export in a secure location your trusted contacts can access when needed (safe deposit box, estate attorney, sealed envelope, etc.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This gives you full control over when and how your information is shared.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Does StackStats Estate Vault store my actual cryptocurrency?</strong>
        <p>No. StackStats Estate Vault is a documentation and planning tool — it does not hold, manage, or transact any cryptocurrency. Think of it as a secure notebook for your digital estate plan. You use it to record where your assets are, how to access them, and who should receive them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I cancel my subscription?</strong>
        <p>Go to Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions on your iPhone, find StackStats Estate Vault, and tap Cancel Subscription. You'll keep Pro access until the end of your current billing period.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>I'm not seeing my subscription / features are locked</strong>
        <p>Try these steps: (1) Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID you used to subscribe. (2) Go to Settings in the app and tap "Restore Purchases." (3) Restart the app. If the issue persists, contact us at the email below.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What happens if I delete the app?</strong>
        <p>Your data is stored locally, so deleting the app will remove your StackStats Estate Vault data. <strong>Always export your vault before uninstalling.</strong> If you reinstall, you'll start fresh unless you restore from a device backup that includes the app data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Can I use StackStats Estate Vault for non-crypto assets?</strong>
        <p>Absolutely. While StackStats Estate Vault is designed for digital assets like cryptocurrency, you can use it to document any digital account, password manager, or online service you want your heirs to know about. The asset types are flexible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>⚠️ Important Reminder</strong>
        <p>StackStats Estate Vault is a planning tool, not a substitute for legal estate planning. We recommend working with an estate attorney to ensure your digital asset plan is legally valid in your jurisdiction.</p>
