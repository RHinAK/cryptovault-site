    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 6, 2026</p>

    <p>StackStats Estate Vault - Estate Planner ("the App") is developed by Rodney Hughey ("we", "our", "us"). We take your privacy extremely seriously — especially given the sensitive nature of digital asset and estate planning information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>🔒 Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> StackStats Estate Vault is designed so that we literally cannot access your data. All information is stored exclusively on your device. There are no servers, no cloud sync, no accounts, and no way for us — or anyone else — to see what you store in the app.
    </div>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We collect absolutely nothing.</strong> All data you enter into the App — including digital asset records, wallet addresses, recovery instructions, trusted contact information, estate letters, documents, and checklist items — is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data never leaves your device through the App.</p>

    <h2>Local-Only Storage</h2>
    <p>StackStats Estate Vault uses a strict local-only data model. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your data is stored on your iPhone or iPad only</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted to any server, cloud service, or third party</li>
        <li>The App does not require an internet connection to function</li>
        <li>There is no account creation, login, or registration</li>
        <li>We have no database, no backend, and no way to access your information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Face ID / Biometric Authentication</h2>
    <p>The App uses Face ID (or Touch ID) to protect access to your vault. When you enable biometric lock:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authentication is handled entirely by Apple's LocalAuthentication framework on your device</li>
        <li>Your biometric data (face scan, fingerprint) is never accessed by the App</li>
        <li>We do not store, process, or transmit any biometric information</li>
        <li>The App simply receives a "yes" or "no" from your device's secure enclave</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Camera Access</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may access your device camera to photograph documents, hardware wallets, or other items for storage in your document vault. Photos taken through the App are stored locally on your device. We do not upload, transmit, or access these photos.</p>

    <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may access your photo library to attach existing images to your document vault. Selected images are referenced or copied locally within the App's data store. We do not upload, transmit, or access your photo library contents.</p>

    <h2>Data Export</h2>
    <p>The App provides features to export your vault data as PDF or encrypted files. These exports are generated locally on your device and shared using the standard iOS share sheet. We do not receive copies of your exported data. <strong>You are responsible for the security of exported files once they leave the App.</strong></p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional subscriptions managed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or process any payment information. All subscription transactions are handled by Apple. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how Apple handles your purchase data.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. We do not collect usage data, crash reports, or device information. There are no cookies, no pixels, and no telemetry of any kind.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose your data to any third parties. This is absolute — there are no exceptions, no "trusted partners," and no fine print. Your data is yours alone.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>While we cannot access your data (by design), we recommend the following to protect your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable Face ID / biometric lock in the App's security settings</li>
        <li>Keep your device passcode strong and private</li>
        <li>Enable device encryption (on by default on modern iOS devices)</li>
        <li>Be cautious when exporting vault data — treat exports as highly sensitive</li>
        <li>Use your device's built-in backup encryption if backing up via computer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
